I enjoy breaking down problems and finding practical solutionsâ€”whether that means simplifying a piece of code or streamlining a workflow. Critical thinking helps me look at each step and consider different approaches. Iâ€™m motivated by making processes a bit more efficient and reliable, knowing that small improvements add up over time.
